# Testable Code Katas 2026

This repo contains “Katas” — exercises for you to do — for learning to write testable code, and to learn to code test-first, and to learn to programme with test driven development.

To learn test-first coding, after learning how to program, is like learning to ride a bicycle backwards after learning to ride a bicycle. It's quite different and it isn't easy. These katas offer a gentle learning curve.
